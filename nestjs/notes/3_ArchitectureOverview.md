# Architecture Overview of nest js 
- Nest js architecture is modular,scalable and maintainable.
- This pattern helps in writing reusable and well-structured code .

### Client(User)
- The person or app that sends a request(e.g,. from browser or mobile). in short frontend
- Triggers the process by accessing an endpoint (like /products.)

### Controller
- Acts like a receptionist
- Request generated by client is received by the controller
- Calls the right service method to handle logic
- Sends back a response to the client

### Service
- Contains business logic(eg, fetch data, apply rules)
- Does not deal with HTTP direcly- just logic

### Provider
- Any class that can be injected and reused (like service, custom classes, etc.)
- Registered in the module to be used via Dependency injection 

### Module
- The container that groups controllers, services and providers.
- Organizes the app into features (Eg., ProductModule, UserModule)
- Helps keep the app scalable and clean

### Dependency Injection
- NestJS automatically provides services where they are needed.
- You don't create new instances manually.
- Improves testability and reusability.

### Decorators
- Special functions starting with @ (eg, @Controller(), @Injectable())
- Tell nestjs how to treat a class, method, or variable
- Used for routing , injecting services, and more.
