### Nest js
- A progressive Node.js framework for building efficient and scalable server-side appliations.
- Built with typescript and heavily inspired by Angular.
- Used modular architecture for better organization.


### Why we need nest js
- To simplify backend development using modern architecture
- Provides a structured way to build scalable and testable applications
- Solves the limitations of traditional express apps.


### Difference between express vs nest

- Express is unopinionated framework. (means there is no fixed structure in this)(we can make project in single file or by multiple folders)(to fixed file name stucture). means it is very flexible. Different developers have different way for writing code 

- Nest js  is opinionated framework . less flexible but more scalable. anyone can understand the code as it has fixed structure

- Nestjs have many build in support like database integration , graphql , rest api


### Benefits of nest js 
- Fully supports Typescript
- Built-in dependency injection system
- Easy integration with databases, websockets,graphql, microservices
- Scalbale and maintainable codebase
- Active and growing community support
