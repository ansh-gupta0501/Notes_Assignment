- to create a private network over aws. as suppose if there are 10 users who create ec2 instance so all users use  a shared network , but if we have our private network , we will have more control over it as we manage it privately ourselves. Secondly , we isolated from their default network. 


Excellent line of thinking, Ansh! Let's break down and explain your statement in detail:

### ðŸ§¾ **Your Statement:**
> *"As suppose if there are 10 users who create EC2 instances, all users use a shared network. But if we have our private network, we will have more control over it as we manage it privately ourselves. Secondly, we are isolated from their default network."*

### âœ… **Detailed Explanation:**

#### 1. **Shared Network for EC2 Instances (Without VPC)**
- In the **early days of AWS**, EC2 instances were launched in a **shared network environment** called **EC2-Classic**.
- In EC2-Classic:
  - All instances shared the same network infrastructure.
  - There was **limited control** over IP addressing, routing, and security.
  - Users could not define subnets or route tables.
- This model was **less secure and less customizable**.

> ðŸ”’ **EC2-Classic is now deprecated** for most accounts. Today, EC2 instances are launched inside a **VPC by default**.

---

#### 2. **Private Network with VPC**
- When you create a **VPC**, you're building a **logically isolated private network** within AWS.
- Inside your VPC, you can:
  - Define your own **IP ranges** (CIDR blocks).
  - Create **public and private subnets**.
  - Control **routing** with route tables.
  - Set up **firewalls** using security groups and network ACLs.
  - Use **NAT gateways**, **VPNs**, and **VPC peering** for advanced networking.

> âœ… This gives you **full control** over how your EC2 instances communicateâ€”internally and externally.

---

#### 3. **Isolation from Default Network**
- Your VPC is **completely isolated** from other users' VPCs and from the default AWS network.
- No traffic can flow between VPCs unless you **explicitly configure** it (e.g., via VPC Peering or Transit Gateway).
- This isolation ensures:
  - **Security**: No accidental data leakage.
  - **Compliance**: You can meet regulatory requirements.
  - **Customization**: You can design your network architecture as needed.

### ðŸ§  Summary Analogy:
Think of AWS like a large office building:
- **EC2-Classic** was like working in a shared open floorâ€”everyone's desks are in the same space.
- **VPC** is like having your own private office suiteâ€”you control the layout, access, and security.



- suppose we choose mumbai region in which we create a vpc with name my-vpc. Now what actually happened when we create a vpc ?
- So when we create a vpc, we basically provide a CIDR block of IP addresses (as network is nothing but set of ip addresses)
- So when we create this private network,  we assign a set of IPs to it, so that we can use it with different devices for further communication.
- CIDR is a method for allocating IP addresses and routing internet protocol packets.
- if we use /28 for cidr block which means we have only 16 ips available to use .


### Subnets
- now our vpc is formed in which we have many ips. so for example we have vpc in which we have 100ips available for use .we divide this in two parts , public subnet and private subnets give them 50 ips each . 
- whatever resource you create like ec2 instance, then this ec2 instance is created inside the subnet. You cannot use the vpc directly. Your resource will be created inside the subnet . as you can see in the diagram , multiple instances inside the subnet . 
- when you create ec2 instance , you get an ip assigned to you  , this ip will be in the same range of subnets  that you are providing.
- why we create different subnets inside vpc because there are some ec2 instances on which you should deploy the frontend and it should be accessible on internet . You have some application such as database which you don't want to make accessible from the internet directly for the security point of view . so different purposes so we make some ips public and some ips private . so database , backend instances will be created in private subnets and frontend instances will be in public subnet. 

- now as there are multiple availabily zones(a,b,c) in a region  , so subnet created is created in the available zone . because available zone are real physical servers.

- We can create multiple subnets on one availability zone or create different subnets on different available zone. 

- when creating vpc , we provide a CIDR range but when we create subnet , we provide range of ips which will be inside range of vpc


### Route table
- we crated our subnets inside the network. different data is flowing from different subnets. Now who will decide where to divert / forward that data. it is decided by route table which helps traffic is flowing in your network in the right direction. 
- In routing table , there are routes which are called set of rules and in that rules , we tell if data is coming from this subnet then where to forward it. 
- Route table is associated with subnet so we define rules in route table like if data is coming from public subnet from any zone then forward it to internet gateway .But if data is coming from private subnet then forward it to vpc endpoint.

- Now there is default vpc formed by aws in which we have default main route table. in that table there is rule set 0.0.0.0/0 which means to forward all subnets inside this vpc and all data inside this to internet gateway . 


### Internet Gateway 
- you created subnets, put resources in it. So how will your resources be easily accessibly from the internet? This is done by internet gateway 
- in the diagram , we see that we attach internet gateway with our vpc and this internet gateway is accessible and connected to the outer world meaning internet.
- Now you want to make the resources public inside second subnet. So you can forward this subnet to the internet gateway using the routes or rule of the routing table.

### Security Groups
- Now when we create instances inside subnet such as ec2 instance. so what data do we want to send on the ec2 instance either inbound or outbound , what to allow , what not to allow  , we control that through security group
- these are firewall rules but it is instance specific
- let say , you create two ec2 instances within the subnet, you can create separate security groups for both ec2 instancs or you can create one group and share both but security group works on any one instance level 
- like we need to allow http request on our website hosted on ec2 instance . it is inbound as request comes from internet . bydefault ec2 instance will not be allowed to you 


### Network ACLs(Access control list)
- it differs from security group as it works on the subnet level 
- it has allow or deny rule both but in security group we have only allow inbound or outboud 

### NAT (Network address translation ) gateway 
- we created a private instance inside private subnet and you had to set up database on it. NOw we don't want to allow internet to database directly but database have to do some functions internally like updgrade a version or update itself so he need to download some files means he can accepts request from instance to outside but not from outside to instance . means for one way communication we use nat
- so he will connect through internet gateway with the help of nat gateway
