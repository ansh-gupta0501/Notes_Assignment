# context object 

- In context object , the infrastructure of your lambda function, small information realted to it is stored.
- like its name, memory limit , function version , arm , aws resource name of function and many things .

# Synchronous and Asynchronous invocations 

- create a lambda function and set its timeout 30 seconds 
- Now write a code 

```javascript
export const handler = async(event,context)=>{
    await new Promise(resolve => setTimeOut(resolve,5000))
    console.log('event',event)
    return {
        'statusCode' : 200,
        'body' : JSON.stringify('Hello from lambda!')
    }
}

// this lambda function will be delayed for 5 seconds before giving response 
```
- if we test this code without cli , then got output as 
```
{
  "statusCode": 200,
  "body": "\"Hello from Lambda!\""
}
```

- Now in this we have to wait for the function till we do not get the response. 
- This waiting time is called synchronous
- Now to test synchronous behaviour , use cloudshell cli  , by writing command **aws lambda invoke --function-name name_of_your_Function output.txt**   . this output.txt is name of file where we store the function output 
- this will give result after 5 seconds with status code 200
```
{
    "StatusCode": 200,
    "ExecutedVersion": "$LATEST"
}

```
- and in output.txt file we get output 
```
{"statusCode":200,"body":"\"Hello from Lambda!\""}~ $ 
```
- by writing this on cli , if we check cloudwatch logs we get event value as empty object as we did not pass event object by cli 

- NOw to test asynchronous behaviour , use command **aws lambda invoke --function-name name_of_your_Function --invocation-type Event output.txt**
- this command will return response immediately with status code 202 and in output.txt , there will not be any output 

```
{
    "StatusCode": 202
}
```

- so in synchronous invocations:- client wait for lambda function to execute and then get the output 
- in asynchronous , user pass the event value will be stored in event queue and different process will run which pass this event value to lambda function and lambda function will process it side by side
- in cloudwatch logs , event object will still be empty 
- for eg, s3 trigger the lambda function asynchronously
