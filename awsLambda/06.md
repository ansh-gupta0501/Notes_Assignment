# General Configuration of AWS lambda function 

- Go to Configuration > General Configuration 
- In that we have 5 parameters : Description, Memory, Ephemeral storage, Timeout, SnapStart

## üìù 1. **Description**

### What it is:
A simple text field where you describe what your Lambda function does.

### Why it's useful:
- Helps you and your team understand the purpose of the function.
- Useful for documentation and maintenance.
- Doesn‚Äôt affect performance or cost.

---

## üß† 2. **Memory**

### What it is:
The amount of memory allocated to your Lambda function (from **128 MB to 10,240 MB**).

### Why it matters:
- **Memory directly affects CPU power**: More memory = more CPU = faster execution.
- **Billing is based on memory √ó execution time**:
  - If you allocate 128 MB and your function runs for 5 seconds, you‚Äôre billed for 128 MB √ó 5 seconds.
  - If you allocate 10 GB but only use 5 MB, you‚Äôre still billed for 10 GB √ó 5 seconds.

### Best practices:
- Start with a lower memory setting.
- Use **Lambda Power Tuning** to find the optimal memory-performance-cost balance.
- Increase memory if your function is CPU-intensive (e.g., image processing, ML inference).

## üìÅ 3. **Ephemeral Storage (/tmp)**

### What it is:
Temporary disk space available to your function during execution. Default is **512 MB**, but can be increased up to **10 GB**.

### Why it matters:
- Used for **temporary files**, like downloading data, processing images, or storing intermediate results.
- If your function needs to handle large files (e.g., 3 GB), you must increase this value.

### Example:
```js
fs.writeFileSync('/tmp/myfile.txt', data);
```

### Best practices:
- Clean up `/tmp` after use.
- Monitor usage to avoid exceeding limits.

## ‚è±Ô∏è 4. **Timeout**

### What it is:
Maximum time your function is allowed to run. Default is **3 seconds**, maximum is **15 minutes**.

### Why it matters:
- If your function exceeds the timeout, it is **forcefully terminated** and returns an error.
- Useful for controlling cost and preventing runaway executions.

### Best practices:
- Set timeout slightly above your expected execution time.
- Use retries or Step Functions for long-running workflows.

---

## ‚ö° 5. **SnapStart** (for Java functions only, as of now)

### What it is:
A feature that **pre-warms** your Lambda function by taking a **snapshot of the initialized environment** during deployment.

### Why it matters:
- Reduces **cold start latency** significantly.
- Especially useful for functions with heavy initialization (e.g., database connections, SDK setup).

### How it works:
- During deployment, AWS runs your function up to the initialization phase.
- It saves a snapshot of the environment.
- When a new execution environment is needed, AWS **restores from the snapshot** instead of starting from scratch.

### Best practices:
- Keep heavy setup (e.g., DB connections, config loading) **outside the handler** to benefit from SnapStart.
- Use SnapStart for latency-sensitive applications.
