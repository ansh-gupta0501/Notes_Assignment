# version of lambda functions 

- we can create multiple version of our lambda functions 

- suppose we create a lambda function named versions and write code 
```javascript
export const handler = async (event) => {
  // TODO implement
  const response = {
    statusCode: 200,
    body: JSON.stringify('Hello from Lambda v1'),
  };
  return response;
};

```

- Now go to Versions tab and publish new version , named it v1
- Also remember , all the version we made are immutable, means we can't change any configuration , any environmental variable , any function url etc. 

- Now create a new version v2 by going to $latest version and update the code and publish new vesion v2


- Now you can update only $latest version , 

- Now we want something like v1 is in production , v2 is in testing and $latest version is in development . Now our v2 is tested and now we want to put it in production but we don't want that our all users, traffic go to this v2 version directly . we only want only 10% traffic go to v2 and other 90% remain in v1 . If 10% of v2 face not any problems then we give all 90% traffic v2 version . So this thing can be done by **alias**.

# Alias

- Alias are your mutable pointers which points to your version . 

- Now we make alias for production , testing , development 
- Go to aliases tab and create alias 
- First make dev alias  which assign version $LATEST
- Second make prod alias which assign version 1
- third make test alias which assign version 2  

- Now we know alias are mutable so we can change any configuration of , suppose we made function url of test alias 

- now we see as our test alias is working fine , now we want to move this to prod alias not completely only 50% 

- so go to prod alias > weighted alias . give additional version 2 and weight 50 % so that 50% traffic come to v2

- now to check , make function url of this prod alias and continously refresh the page , we see sometimes it comes hello from lambda v2 and sometimes it comes hello form lambda v1 which indicates sometimes it comes to v1 and sometimes it comes to v2 

- now we can give prod alias completely v2 from v1 
- also , node we can only change configurations of aliases not the code itself 

- in summary , Lambda aliases are mutable pointers because their primary purpose is to provide a flexible way to manage deployments and traffic routing
