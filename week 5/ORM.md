## üß† What is ORM?

**ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)** is a programming technique used to interact with a **relational database (like PostgreSQL)** using **objects in your programming language**.

Instead of writing raw SQL queries, you interact with the database using JavaScript/TypeScript classes and methods.

## üí° Why Use ORM?

* ‚úÖ Simplifies database operations (CRUD).
* ‚úÖ Avoids raw SQL (safer from SQL injection).
* ‚úÖ Easier to maintain and scale.
* ‚úÖ Better integration with code (models = real objects).

## üîß How ORM Works

| Concept in DB | In ORM      |
| ------------- | ----------- |
| Table         | Model/Class |
| Row           | Object      |
| Column        | Property    |
| SQL Query     | Method call |

## üß± Types of ORM

1. ### **Full-featured ORMs** (Data Mapper / Active Record):

   * Handle migrations, validations, associations, etc.
   * Example: **Sequelize**, **TypeORM**

2. ### **Query Builders** (Not true ORMs):

   * Help write SQL in a programmatic way but don‚Äôt use models.
   * Example: **Knex.js**

3. ### **Lightweight ORMs**:

   * Minimal abstraction over SQL.
   * Example: **Objection.js** (built on Knex)

## üöÄ Popular ORMs for Node.js + PostgreSQL

### 1. **Sequelize** (Most Popular)

* Type: Active Record
* Features: Associations, Migrations, Hooks, Eager/Lazy Loading
* Easy to get started.

### 2. **TypeORM**

* Type: Data Mapper (but can work as Active Record)
* Great with TypeScript
* Decorators-based (similar to Java's Hibernate)

### 3. **Objection.js**

* Type: Lightweight ORM
* Built on Knex.js
* Uses plain JavaScript classes
* Powerful and flexible

### 4. **Prisma** (Modern & Type-Safe)

* Type: Next-gen ORM
* Auto-generates types, clean syntax
* Schema-based, very developer-friendly
* Excellent for TypeScript

## üîç Advanced ORM Concepts

1. **Model Associations**:

   * `hasOne`, `hasMany`, `belongsTo`, `belongsToMany`
   * Used to define relationships like users and posts.

2. **Scopes & Queries**:

   * Custom reusable query logic.

3. **Transactions**:

   * Ensures data consistency when executing multiple queries.

4. **Migrations**:

   * Version-controlled DB schema changes.
   * Example: `sequelize-cli`

5. **Hooks**:

   * Functions before/after create/update/delete (e.g., for auditing or validation)

6. **Validation**:

   * Define constraints and checks at model level.

## üÜö Sequelize vs Prisma vs TypeORM

| Feature     | Sequelize     | Prisma       | TypeORM     |
| ----------- | ------------- | ------------ | ----------- |
| Style       | Active Record | Schema-based | Data Mapper |
| Type Safety | ‚ùå (JS)        | ‚úÖ (best)     | ‚úÖ (good)    |
| Migrations  | ‚úÖ             | ‚úÖ (great)    | ‚úÖ           |
| Community   | Large         | Growing fast | Good        |
| Performance | Good          | Very good    | Decent      |
