## üîç Breakdown of `package.json`

```json
{
  "name": "expressandtypescript",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
    "dev" : "nodemon src/app.ts",
    "build": "tsc -p .",
    "start" : "node dist/app.js"
  },
  ...
}
```

### üîß Scripts

| Script  | Command              | What it Does                                                                                                                        |
| ------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `dev`   | `nodemon src/app.ts` | Starts your app with **nodemon**, which watches file changes and restarts the server. It uses `ts-node` to run TypeScript directly. |
| `build` | `tsc -p .`           | Runs the TypeScript compiler (`tsc`) using your project‚Äôs `tsconfig.json`. Transpiles `.ts` files into `.js` in a `dist/` folder.   |
| `start` | `node dist/app.js`   | Runs the **compiled JavaScript** (from `build`) using Node.                                                                         |

## üß© Dependencies

### `devDependencies`

These are needed **only during development**:

| Package          | Purpose                                                                                                   |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `@types/express` | TypeScript type definitions for Express. Allows TypeScript to understand the types for `req`, `res`, etc. |
| `nodemon`        | Watches files and restarts the server when changes are made.                                              |
| `ts-node`        | Runs TypeScript files directly without compiling to JS first.                                             |
| `typescript`     | The TypeScript compiler (tsc), used to convert `.ts` to `.js`.                                            |

---

## üöÄ Your Code (`app.ts`)

```ts
import express, { Request, Response } from 'express'

const app = express()

app.get('/', (req: Request, res: Response) => {
    res.send("Welcome to express server with typescript")
})

app.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log('Server is running on port 3000')
})
```

---

## ‚ùì Why `node app.ts` doesn‚Äôt work

When you try:

```bash
node app.ts
```

You get an error like:

```
SyntaxError: Unknown file extension ".ts" for C:\Users\ansh.gupta\Documents\Work\expressAndTypescript\src\app.ts    
```

### ‚ùó Reason:

Node.js **cannot execute TypeScript files directly.** It only understands **JavaScript**. Also, the `import` syntax requires either:

* A module system (like ES modules), or
* Transpiling with TypeScript.

---

## ‚úÖ Why `npm run dev` **works**

The `dev` script is:

```bash
nodemon src/app.ts
```

Here's what happens under the hood:

1. **Nodemon** sees that the file is `.ts`, and you're using `ts-node` (since it's in your devDependencies).
2. Nodemon automatically uses `ts-node` to run the file.
3. So `ts-node src/app.ts` is what‚Äôs really running.

That‚Äôs why the server runs even though it's still `.ts`.

‚úÖ You don‚Äôt need to manually compile your TypeScript files with `tsc` when using `ts-node`.

---

## üß† How it works under the hood

When you run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Steps:

1. `nodemon src/app.ts` starts.
2. Nodemon checks the file extension and finds it's `.ts`.
3. It finds `ts-node` is installed.
4. It uses `ts-node` to execute `src/app.ts`.
5. `ts-node`:

   * Compiles TypeScript in memory (no `.js` files created).
   * Runs the resulting JavaScript code immediately.

## üõ† When to Use What

| Task                                  | Use This                                   |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Development (quick start, hot reload) | `npm run dev`                              |
| Production build (clean JS output)    | `npm run build && npm start`               |
| Debugging TypeScript issues           | Use `tsc` directly to see compiler errors. |

Great question!

### ‚úÖ Short Answer:

Yes, **`@types/express`** is **needed** when you're using TypeScript with Express ‚Äî **especially** if you're importing `Request` and `Response` types like:

```ts
import express, { Request, Response } from 'express';
```

Now let‚Äôs dive deeper into **why**, and what happens if you **don‚Äôt** use or import them.

---

## üîç What is `@types/express`?

* Express is written in **JavaScript**, not TypeScript.
* TypeScript needs **type definitions** to understand the types used in a JavaScript library.
* `@types/express` provides these definitions.
* Without it, TypeScript will treat `Request`, `Response`, etc., as **`any`**, and you lose all benefits of type safety and IntelliSense.

---

## üîß What happens **if you remove `@types/express`**?

1. **TypeScript compiler (`tsc`) will complain**:

   ```
   Cannot find module 'express' or its corresponding type declarations.
   ```

2. **Autocomplete and type checking are gone**:

   * You won't get IntelliSense for `req.body`, `res.status()`, etc.
   * You might use `req.query.name` thinking it's a string, but it's actually `string | undefined` ‚Äî which TypeScript would normally warn you about.

---

## üß™ What happens if you don‚Äôt use `Request`, `Response`?

You can write this and it will still work at runtime:

```ts
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send("Welcome to express server with typescript");
});
```

But in TypeScript:

* `req` and `res` will be inferred as `any` (or `unknown` with `strict` mode).
* You **lose all the benefits of type checking**.

For example:

```ts
req.body.username.toLowerCase();
```

TypeScript won't warn you if `username` doesn't exist ‚Äî and you'll get a runtime error like:

```
Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'toLowerCase')
```

---

## ‚úÖ Benefits of using `Request`, `Response`

```ts
app.get('/', (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  const name = req.query.name; // Type is known: string | ParsedQs | string[] | ParsedQs[]
  res.send("Welcome!");
});
```

With `@types/express`, TypeScript knows:

* What `req.query`, `req.body`, etc., look like.
* That `res.send()` returns a `Response`.

This helps:

* Prevent bugs at compile time.
* Get better editor support (autocomplete, suggestions).
* Write safer, more maintainable code.

## üîö Summary

| Feature        | Without `@types/express` | With `@types/express` |
| -------------- | ------------------------ | --------------------- |
| Compiles?      | ‚ùå or with type errors    | ‚úÖ                     |
| Runtime works? | ‚úÖ                        | ‚úÖ                     |

| Autocomplete?  | ‚ùå                        | ‚úÖ                     |

---

## ‚úÖ Do We Need to Import `@types/express`?

**No, you do not need to explicitly import it.**

When you install `@types/express`, it's used **automatically by TypeScript** to provide **type definitions** for the `express` package. That‚Äôs how TypeScript knows what `Request`, `Response`, `app.get`, etc. mean ‚Äî even though you're importing only from `'express'`.

### Example:

```ts
import express, { Request, Response } from 'express';
```

You're importing from `express`, **not** from `@types/express`.

> `@types/express` just adds type info to the `express` module. You **don‚Äôt** need to write:
>
> ```ts
> import '@types/express'; // ‚ùå unnecessary
> ```

---

## ü§î What is the `@` in `@types/express`?

The `@` means it's a **scoped package** ‚Äî specifically, a package under the **`@types` scope** on npm.

### `@types/*` packages are:

* Created and maintained by the **DefinitelyTyped** community.
* Used to add TypeScript support to plain JavaScript libraries.
* Follow the naming convention: `@types/library-name`

So:

| JS Library | TypeScript Types  |
| ---------- | ----------------- |
| `express`  | `@types/express`  |
| `lodash`   | `@types/lodash`   |
| `mongoose` | `@types/mongoose` |

If a library is written in JavaScript and doesn't include its own types, you install its types like this:

```bash
npm install --save-dev @types/library-name
```

## üìå TL;DR

| Question                                         | Answer                                                                                                        |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Do I need to import `@types/express` in my code? | ‚ùå No                                                                                                          |
| What does `@types/express` do?                   | It adds type definitions so TypeScript knows what `express`, `Request`, `Response`, etc. mean                 |
| What does the `@` mean?                          | It's a scoped npm package (from the `@types` namespace)                                                       |
| Why is this useful?                              | It gives you autocomplete, compile-time error checking, and strong typing for libraries written in JavaScript |
