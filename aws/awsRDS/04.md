# Proxy in RDS
- can be used to fasten the speed of your application 

- when we run a sql query on the ec2 instance after connecting to mysql server for example, then there is some opeartions performed behind the scenes between application server and database . 
- these operations are 
1) application driver like mysql command opens a connection between ec2 instance and rds instance. 
2) In the opearting system , a network socket opens , and also before network socket , authentication happens that is the password provided by user is correct or not 
3) Now the query executes , output comes , after that connection will be closed , and then network socket connection will be closed 

- means for a query to run , behind the scenes multiple operations(let's assume 5) perform on the operating system level. 

- if one query has to run then no problem 
- if 1 millions of request comes , the total count of opeartion runs 1 * 5 = 5 millions which increases cpu utilisation , memory utilisation 

- so to solve this problem , we can make a proxy , proxy will between your opearting system and your database . And there will be a connection between your database and proxy . so it will always have atleast 1 connection open (means there will be some connection pool which he will reuse ), means all the internal 5 operations will already present . So your query will hit directly  and you get the response which perserver you cpu and memory utilization . 

- hence , we can use database proxy . 


- Now go to database and create proxy 
- We can create proxy for specific databases only like mariaDB , MYSQL , PostgreSQL, SQL Server 

- name the proxy as youtube-demo-proxy-server

- Now we can give timeout means one request come , connection pool formed , now for how time this connection pool remain available inside your proxy- give 30 minutes

- Now in target group configuration , we mention database on which request forward when request comes to proxy 

- now give maximum allowed connections
