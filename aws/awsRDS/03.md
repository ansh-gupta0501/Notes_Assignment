# Multi AZ in RDS 

- Now before we have make a database in single region and availabily zone , but if that region and availablity zone gets down , then our database will also get down

- so there is option Multi A-Z deployment in production/devlopment db instance size. not in free tier 

- In this there is something called standby instance which means it create a replica of the database . Your request will go to primary database but if this database got down due to down of availability zone in which it is present, then this standby instance got active and query will not come to this standby database.  

- also it is not compulsory to give same size to standby database and primary database . We can give more size to standby database and if primary database is full then data can be stored in standby database
