# Read Replica

- suppose we have e-commerce application , means user orders an item and you make an entry at database . this is write operation 
- user can also see his all past orders 
- Now after 2 years , you want to see analytics of your application , and for this , you need to read data from database which causes huge read operation on database . 
- Now as our database is also doing other task like write opeartion , so this can slow our responses from database 
- Now what can we do we make replica( copy) of our database and perfom read operation on this replica. We can't do any write opeartion on this replica 
- Other use of read replica can be debuging as we do not do any debuging queries on our production database .  

- so for making read replica on database we have made database1:-
- go to action and create read replica , 
-  replica source is our database for which we have to make read replica
- give name read-replica-database1
- rest is default and at last enable delection protection which prevent accidently deletion of this read replica 

- you can create read replica in different region also
