# zero donwtime API Updates with AWS Lambda Alias & versioning & stage variables 

- we have a lambda function versions in which we have made 2 version of our code and 3 alias test , prod , dev, dev is our latest version . 

- now we have a api gateway in which we have 3 stages stage/dev , stage/test  , stage/prod

-  stage/dev will point to latest lambda alias $latest 
- stage/test will point to lambda alias test - v2 
- stage/prod will point to lambda alias prod - v1

- Now assume on prod stage , everthing is fine but we update our lambda code
