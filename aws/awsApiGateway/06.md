# Create Dummy APIs with API Gateway 

- create a new resource /mock 
- create a method GET and choose integratin type MOCK THEN crate method 
- in MOCK , you don't have any backend , means in case of lambda your backend is lambda , in case of http you hit a http server. in case of mock , you don't have anything , you get all response from API gateway directly, nothing goes to server  
- so now go to intergration response , edit this and provide your sample template for your data response . 
- Now hit request , you get the same output , 
- this is helpful when you don't have backend yet , but want to test your frontend with api
