# Create Dummy APIs with API Gateway 

- create a new resource /mock 
- create a method GET and choose integratin type MOCK THEN crate method 
- in MOCK , you don't have any backend , means in case of lambda your backend is lambda , in case of http you hit a http server. in case of mock , you don't have anything , you get all response from API gateway directly, nothing goes to server
