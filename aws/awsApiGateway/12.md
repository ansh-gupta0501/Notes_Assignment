# Add validations on API Gateway  using method request 

- Now we can put some validations like in request url , there should be content-type or like query string parameters must be passed in the lambda function. 
- but what if before reached the lambda we verify the request , as it will save cost of hit lambda function


- so first take validation in query parameter we should have both page and size for paginaiton 
- so go to method request and edit and in query string parameter, add page and size and make required 
- also need to enable the request validator on where we want to enable it , on body , query string , headers

- now go to http request headers and make content-type and required it true

- we can test this using either postman or test tab

- we can also validate body also in this 
- in same method request , we have request body where we can select model
- now but before we need to make our own model , by going to model tab , name the model , content-type application/json and in model schema , need to write comple schema 
- but we don't know how to write schema so go any website json schema generator and write you json data which you requered and then your schema will generate 

- now if we send request body then api gateway will first verify is it the correct request body we want 

The Content-Type specifies the media type of the request payload that the model applies to. It tells API Gateway:

Which type of request body the model should validate.
How to parse the payload (e.g., as JSON, XML, etc.).


- now the model scheam generated is like 
{
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-04/schema#",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "id": {
      "type": "integer"
    },
    "name": {
      "type": "string"
    },
    "age": {
      "type": "integer"
    }
  },
  "required": [
    "id",
    "name",
    "age"
  ]
}
