- Now the 4 subnets we have make , need to divide it into public and private subnets 

- So make subnet 1 and subnet 3 private and subnet 2 and subnet 4 public 

- so make a new route table , name it private-route-table-youtube , and select your vpc , create it 
- now go to your private subnet i.e, subnet 1  , edit route table association ,  and select your private-route-table-youtube, save it 
- similarly do with private subnet 3

- So now subnet 1 and 3 are private , internet not accessible.
- Now check subnet  of your ec2 instance , we have created it in network 2 whihc is public subnet 

- create a new instance and put it in private subnet . also you can enable or disable auto assign public ip but you should not 

```

No, you **do not need to enable auto-assign public IP** when launching an EC2 instance in a **private subnet**â€”in fact, you typically **should not**.

Hereâ€™s why:

### ðŸ”’ Private Subnet Characteristics
A **private subnet** is designed to host resources that **do not need direct access to the internet**. These instances:
- Communicate with the internet **via a NAT Gateway or NAT instance** (for outbound traffic).
- Are **not directly accessible from the internet** (no inbound traffic from public IPs).

### ðŸ›‘ Auto-Assign Public IP
If you enable **auto-assign public IP**:
- The instance will get a public IP, which contradicts the idea of a private subnet.
- It may expose the instance to the internet if security groups and route tables allow it.

### âœ… Best Practices
- **Disable auto-assign public IP** for instances in private subnets.
- Use a **NAT Gateway** in a public subnet to allow outbound internet access (e.g., for software updates).
- Use **bastion hosts** or **Session Manager** for secure SSH access if needed.

```
- give security rule to this private instance for ping (icmp)
- you will see we can't connect this private ec2 instance now

- connect your public instance and ping for this private instance , you see you can do that means these 2 instance can connect with each other, 


- now we know database server should be in private subnet and application server in public subnet 

- but in acutally industry level , we also keep application server in private subnet . Then how end user can access application server ?

- Keep your proxy server inside the public network , and in proxy server only nginx will be installed . Whatever user requests ,it will go to nginx server and nginx server will send the request to your application server and application server will respond to your nginx and nginx will response to end user
- in industry level , application server don't directly talk with outer world 
- First there is load balancer, under the load balaner , proxies are placed , under the proxy your application server is placed and under the application server , your database server is placed. you can also add your inmemory databases also.

- Now if your instance is in private subnet , then how can you install database on it , apt get updata / upgrade/install  command will not work ??
