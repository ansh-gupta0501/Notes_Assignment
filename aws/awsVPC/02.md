- Now in the privous vpc we made in which we mention cidr block as 
```
192.168.0.0/16

so range is 

192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255
```

- Now suppose this 192.168.0.0/16 we define for college network and  in college  we have 4 different branches. Now we have to make small and separate network for all these branches . Means we divide 192.168.0.0/16 into smaller networks 

- This is called subnetting 

- subnetting means divide the big network into small parts 

- Now we make 4 different network for 192.168.0.0/16 with particular ranges 

```
Network 1: 192.168.1.0 - 192.168.1.255
Network 2: 192.168.2.0 - 192.168.2.255
Network 3: 192.168.3.0 - 192.168.3.255
Network 4: 192.168.4.0 - 192.168.4.255

So cidr for all these will be 
Network 1 : 192.168.1.0/24         // as we fix first 24 bits
Network 2 : 192.168.2.0/24
Network 3 : 192.168.3.0/24
Network 4 : 192.168.4.0/24

these are called cidr of subnets 
```
- So now create subnet in which select vpc (means your big network)

- Also remember subnet will be on availability zone 
- NOw create subnet 1 , name it network - 1
- give availablity zone as US East (N Virginia)/us-east-1a
- now give cird 192.168.1.0/24 

- now create subnet 

- similarly create 3 more subnet with different available zone 
- you can create subnet in same zone so lets say 1st and 3rd subnet in same zone and 2nd and 4th subnet in same zone
