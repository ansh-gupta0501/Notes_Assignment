# Resource Policy and IAM Role in AWS lambda 

- If we go to configuration > permissions tab of any lambda function , we see two things :- Execution role and Resource-based policy statements 

- In execution role , lambda should have permission to access other services like s3 bucket . In the role , we add policy that if this role is attached to any resource , what are the permission they have 


- in resource-based policy, who can execute our lambda function , that permission we are given

- like if we see resource-based policy of our lambda function , we see there that ALB can execute our lambda function
