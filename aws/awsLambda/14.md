# AWS Lambda in VPC 

- Go to layers lambda function and check vpc in configuration > vpc tab. we see there is not vpc connected , then how this is working , how networking is done for this. 
- So by default , when we create lambda function , vpc is managed by aws. We don't manage it . aws provide it intenet connectivity and it works 


- so first we need to give create network permission to this lambda function by going to permissions > IAM role 
- for simplicity , we give admin access to this lambda 

- no edit vpc , give all details , give vpc, subnet , security group 

- Now test the function , we get error 
```
{
  "errorType": "Sandbox.Timedout",
  "errorMessage": "RequestId: 3c9e955d-311b-473a-af52-2d6be59d03e0 Error: Task timed out after 3.00 seconds"
}
```

- Now increase the timeout to let's say, 30 seconds ,  we can either get an error or null response 


**This is because if our lambda function is connected to default vpc provided by aws means we don't provide it any vpc , then it have internet connectivity but if we provide our own vpc , then whether it is in public subnet and we have define rules in route table like forward all to internet gateway , lambda function does not get internet connectivity because 
Lambda doesn’t get a public IP.Without a public IP, it can’t use the Internet Gateway. To provide internet connectivity to lambda function , make it in private subnet and attached nat gateway to its route table.**


Here’s a **step-by-step guide** to set up **internet access for your AWS Lambda function** using a **private subnet + NAT Gateway**:

## 🛠️ Step-by-Step Setup in AWS Console

### **1. Create a VPC**
- Go to **VPC Dashboard** → **Create VPC**
- Choose **VPC only** option
- Give it a name (e.g., `MyLambdaVPC`)
- Set CIDR block (e.g., `10.0.0.0/16`)

---

### **2. Create Subnets**
#### 🔹 Public Subnet
- CIDR block: `10.0.1.0/24`
- Enable **Auto-assign public IP**
- Name it `PublicSubnet`

#### 🔹 Private Subnet
- CIDR block: `10.0.2.0/24`
- Name it `PrivateSubnet`

---

### **3. Create an Internet Gateway**
- Go to **Internet Gateways** → **Create**
- Name it `MyIGW`
- Attach it to your VPC

---

### **4. Create a NAT Gateway**
- Go to **NAT Gateways** → **Create NAT Gateway**
- Choose the **Public Subnet**
- Attach an **Elastic IP** (create one if needed)
- Name it `MyNATGateway`

---

### **5. Update Route Tables**
#### 🔹 Public Subnet Route Table
- Destination: `0.0.0.0/0`
- Target: **Internet Gateway**

#### 🔹 Private Subnet Route Table
- Destination: `0.0.0.0/0`
- Target: **NAT Gateway**

Make sure each subnet is associated with the correct route table.

---

### **6. Create Lambda Function**
- Go to **Lambda Console** → **Create Function**
- Choose **Author from scratch**
- In **Network settings**:
  - Select your VPC
  - Choose the **Private Subnet**
  - Select appropriate **Security Group**

---

### ✅ Done! Now your Lambda function can access the internet via the NAT Gateway.


- we create nat gateway in public subnet because 
A NAT Gateway needs to:

Talk to the internet (send and receive traffic).
Have a public IP address (Elastic IP).
Be reachable by AWS services in private subnets.
But only public subnets can:

Assign public IPs.
Route traffic directly to the Internet Gateway.
So, if you put a NAT Gateway in a private subnet, it won’t be able to reach the internet, and your Lambda function will still be stuck without internet access.
 How It Works
Here’s the flow:

Lambda in private subnet → sends request to internet.
Request goes to NAT Gateway (in public subnet).
NAT Gateway uses its Elastic IP to go out via Internet Gateway.
Response comes back through the same path.
