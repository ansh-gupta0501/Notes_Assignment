# Some important points on lambda function

- When you create a lambda function , can you change the file name?
- When you create a lambda function , can you change the function name from handler to anything else?

- Now suppose we have lambda function we created before i.e, event-context , change its file name from index.mjs to func.mjs and test it .
- we get error 
```
{
  "errorType": "Runtime.ImportModuleError",
  "errorMessage": "Error: Cannot find module 'index'\nRequire stack:\n- /var/runtime/index.mjs",
  "trace": [
    "Runtime.ImportModuleError: Error: Cannot find module 'index'",
    "Require stack:",
    "- /var/runtime/index.mjs",
    "    at _loadUserApp (file:///var/runtime/index.mjs:1109:17)",
    "    at async UserFunction.js.module.exports.load (file:///var/runtime/index.mjs:1148:21)",
    "    at async start (file:///var/runtime/index.mjs:1332:23)",
    "    at async file:///var/runtime/index.mjs:1339:1"
  ]
}
```

- This is because it is default settings in runtime settings on lambda function .
- in handler , we see it is written index.handler which means index is our module or file name and handler is function name , change index.handler to func.handler and then run the code 

- now it runs successfuly

- Now change function name and try the same thing.
