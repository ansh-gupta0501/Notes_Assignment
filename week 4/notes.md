# CLIENT - SERVER ARCHITECTURE

- there are two machines client machine and server machine , client makes request to server (say . www.google.com) , server send a response for this request to the client

### How client machine knows where to send request 
- As there are mulitple servers machine on the internet , how this particular client machine knows where to send this request?
- So the request(www.google.com) was first passed to DNR(Domain Name Resolution) and then this request was converted to a address (xx.xx.xx) and this address is of that specific server machine.
- Now server process the request and send the response to client.
