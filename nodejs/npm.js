// npm 
// - It is the world's largerst software library (Registry)
// - It is a software package manager 


// like A book library contains books writtern by various authors
// similarly npm is a library or registry which contains code packages writtern by variaous developers 
// it is a larger public database of js code that developers from all over the world can use to share and borrow code 
// If you author a 'code package' , you can publish it to the npm registry for others to use 
// If you come across a code package that is authorized by someone elese and solves the problem you have at hand , you can borrow that code without having to reinvent the wheel 


// Developers publish and consume code packages but 
// how does a developer publish a package?
// how does a developer consume a package ?
// What happens if the code package author decides to change a function name in a package ?
// How would one update an already installed package?
// What if the package I am consuming is dependent on another package ?

// This is where npm has a package manager for all these 
// we have a command line interface tool that lets us manage packages in a project 



// npm and other package managers 
// other package manager such as pnpm and yarn 
// but npm is the default package manager for node js which is bundled with node js 

// before npm stand for node package manager when it first started out 
// NOw , it is a package manager for the javascript programming language . not only for node

// it is the central place to configure and describe how to interact with and run you package 
// it is primarily used by the npm cli
